Messanger - Send Windows NT Messages To Users 

If you have Windows network with NT Server in your organization, you have now ability to send messages to users that will popup on their screens all of the sudden. This is similar to how you get the message box on the screen when printer completes the printing. Administrators can use this app to send message to users asking them to log out. Or may be you just want to ask a colleague to come for a coffee! This application is right now in state of easy clicks. However you may freely contact me for assistance.
